# 🌍 *Welcome to the UnPlug GitHub Organization!* 🌍

UnPlug, born from the innovative energy of [HackUDC](https://hackudc.gpul.org/), is a solution designed to shed light on electricity bills. Our mission is to empower individuals to take control of their energy consumption, offering innovative tools to demystify electricity bills and promote energy savings. Our commitment is to provide accessible, user-friendly technology solutions that help people understand where their energy comes from, how they're using it, and how they can save money by making smarter consumption choices.

🔌 *What We Do:*
- *Bill Analysis*: Utilizing OCR technology, we transform a photo of your electricity bill into actionable insights.
- *Energy Insights*: Dive deep into your energy habits with detailed analyses based on your actual consumption data.
- *Sustainable Solutions*: Promote the use of renewable energy sources and offer tips for reducing your carbon footprint.

🛠 *Our Tools:*
- Open-source and built on trust, we leverage FOSS tools like [doctr](https://github.com/mindee/doctr) for OCR capabilities and [StableLM Zephyr-3b](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b) from StabilityAI for generating insights, ensuring your data remains secure and private.
